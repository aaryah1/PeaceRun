# PeaceRun
In the game PeaceRun you have to go through an interactive journey where you have to guide your character
through paths through the use of keys. You have to solve escape rooms that represent real life problems
that affect the overall peace of society. The characters goal should be to complete and get past all 
escape rooms to reach the end of the game which represents peace. This game represents us as characters
in the real world, and if we are able to solve each problem one at a time we would be able to reach peace
and tranquility. Your health will increase if you click the butt9on a certain amount of times. At the end once
you've clicked all the button you've escaped most of the problems and your health is at your max.
